# gene selection testing

## Testing variable gene selection methods for single-cell analysis

#### Here we are testing two methods for finding significantly variable genes in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. 

#### One is a homebrew python implemention of finding significant genes based on proportion of dropouts compared against a NULL negative binomial model adapted from the M3drop [package](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/M3Drop.html)

#### The other is the more popularized implementation of analytical pearson residuals adapted from [Lause et al. (2021)](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02451-7#availability-of-data-and-materials)


#### Both of these methods aim to deconvolute the underlying biology with scRNA-seq data by finding genes that significantly deviate from two separate models. Here we highlight the potential benefits and potential limitations of each.
