## Testing variable gene selection methods for single-cell analysis

### Here we are testing two methods for finding significantly variable genes in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. One is a homebrew python implemention of finding significant genes based on proportion of dropouts compared against a NULL negative binomial model adapted from the M3drop [see here]https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/16/2865/5258099
